# osc2laser
osc2laser (***OSC to laser***) enables you to create stunning lasershows - automated by timeline or even by live control. It works on any operating system and with many different applications and laser DACs. It is open-source, driven by the [community](https://github.com/goodtimes-code/osc2laser/graphs/contributors) and [free of charge](#price).

## Use cases
### Timeline lasershow
Use any OSC-enabled software to pre-program your timeline-based lasershow like e.g.
  - [Vez√©r](https://imimot.com/vezer/) (recommended)
  - [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/live/)
  - Chataigne (free)
  - OSSIA score (free)
  - TWO (free)
  - OSC See
  - Millumin
  - QLab
  - ...

### Live lasershow
Send OSC commands from a software of your choice to control your laser live:
  - [open-stage-control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/) (free)
  - [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc)

## Features
- Easy laser output preview (2D)
- Multiple static and animated [laser objects](#laser-objects) included
- Change [parameters](#parameters) of laser objects 
- Many [effects](#effects) for laser objects available

## How it works
1. Start the osc2laser component  ***osc-receiver***. 
 - Provides a 2D preview of your laser output
 - Listens to OSC command from any OSC client
 - Controls the ILDA output of your laser DAC
2. Start any software which sends OSC commands ([some ideas](#use-cases))
 - OSC commands tell the ***osc-receiver*** what to do like...
   - Set laser object (line, circle, dot, wave, ...)
   - Set effect (color, rotatation,...)
   - Set parameters (wave amplitude, length,...)
